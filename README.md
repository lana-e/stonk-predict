# stonk predict
A personal project for me to learn linear regression and long-short term memory machine learning by building a stock movement prediction app. I'm very much still learning so any feedback/criticism is welcome!

The app is run through Streamlit, so you need the Streamlit module installed to run it.

You will have to download `stonk_predict.py` and run it in the Terminal:

`$streamlit run stonk_predict.py`

This will open a tab in your web browser, from which the app will run.
