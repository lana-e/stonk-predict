# stonk predict
A personal project for me to learn linear regression and long-short term memory machine learning by building a stock movement prediction app.

The app is run through Streamlit, so you will have to download stonk_predict.py and run it in the Terminal:
$streamlit run stonk_predict.py

This will open a tab in your web browser, from which the app will run.
